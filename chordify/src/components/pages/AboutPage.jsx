              The idea of establishing NGO came up during the various activities with other 
              NGOs as a part of collaboration with NSS/NCC in college activities. It was a very 
              clear view behind the organization that it will be for young people and specially 
              students development activities will be given priority.
            </p>

              Keeping the ethics and value system in center, the NGO has thought for such 
              activities, which will fill valuable qualities in the youth. NGO is thankful to all the 
              young students of various colleges who are voluntarily giving a boost to the 
              activities. For spreading awareness in the field of adventure, NGO has planned 
              some very charming events as per regular basis.
